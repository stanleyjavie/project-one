    "- **ALASKA** has strong on-time performance in Seattle (1,841 on time vs. 305 delayed).\n",
    "- **AMWEST** has the bulk of its flights in Phoenix (4,840 on time, 415 delayed).\n",
    "- On-time performance percentage:\n",
    "  - ALASKA ≈ 86.6% on time  \n",
    "  - AMWEST ≈ 91.1% on time\n",
    "- Delays are proportionally higher for ALASKA in San Francisco and Seattle compared to AMWEST.\n",
    "- **Conclusion**: Both airlines perform well overall, but AMWEST has a slightly better on-time percentage, largely due to strong Phoenix operations.\n"
